# <ins>Summary: Adaptive bitrate algorithm</ins>

This document describes the adaptive bitrate algorithm implemented in this project along with some following Summary of how these algorithms work and are implemented and how they are different from each other.

**Buffer level**: A buffer(some sort of buffer, queue or any data storing structure) where the video data is stored.
An appropriate buffer is when we could start playback when there is enough bytes in the buffer to prevent video lag.
